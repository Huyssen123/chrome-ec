    The Cr50 version string is generated at build time by the
    ./util/getversion.sh script. The version string is built based on the
    following template:

    cr50_v<vers>-<git sha> tpm2:<vers>-<git sha> ... <year>-<month>-<day>

    Since the Cr50 image includes sections for RW_A and RW_B, the same version
    string is supposed to be present in the image twice.

    This function reads the passed in file name, looks for the version, makes
    sure that the version is present twice and both instances are identical,
    then extracts git hashes of the ec and tpm2 trees from the version string
    and returns them as a list of two integers.
