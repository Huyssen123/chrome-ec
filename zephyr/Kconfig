	  The platform/ec Zephyr module allows some code from the
	  existing Chrome OS EC project to be "shimmed" into Zephyr.

# Below is a hack to use CONFIG_ZEPHYR in platform/ec code before
# config.h has been included.  There is some tricky ordering in some
# header files that we cannot use config.h (e.g., common.h and
# compile_time_macros.h), as many board.h and config_chip.h files
# use these macros, and thus would be included by an include of
# config.h.  We work around this by initially defining CONFIG_ZEPHYR
# in Kconfig as an invisible symbol (it should always be enabled).
# Then, once config.h gets included, it subsequently gets undef'ed by
# config.h, and then redefined by config_chip.h in the Zephyr shim.
config ZEPHYR
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This should always be enabled.  It's a workaround for
	  config.h not being available in some headers.

	bool "Enable keybaord support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable compilation of support for scanning a keyboard and providing
	  the resulting input to the AP over the host interface. This consists
	  of a keyboard-scanning task which provides key scans via it calling
	  keyboard_state_changed() (for i8042) or its client calling
	  keyboard_scan_get_state() (for MKBP).

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042
	bool "i8042"
	help
	  Use the i8042 protocol to communicate with the AP. This dates from the
	  Intel 8042 keyboard controller chip released in 1976. It uses two-way
	  communication via a few 8-bit registers, allowing key codes to be
	  sent to the AP when keys are pressed and released.

config PLATFORM_EC_LID_SWITCH
	bool "Enable the lid switch module"
	help
	  Enable shimming the lid switch implementation and related

	  GPIO_LID_OPEN to be defined in gpio_map.h.

config PLATFORM_EC_I2C
	bool "Enable the EC i2c module"

	help
	  Enable compilation of the EC i2c module. Once enabled, it will be
	  possible to make calls using the old platform/ec i2c APIs defined
	  in include/i2c.h and implemented in common/i2c_master.c. Doing so
	  should make shimming other platform/ec modules which rely on i2c
	  communication "just work" without requiring any further code changes.
