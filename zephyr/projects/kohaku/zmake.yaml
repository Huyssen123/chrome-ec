# Note: below output type is not correct, but good enough for
# developing right now.  We need to run ecst to pack the RO/RW binary
# into the special NPCX format, but don't do that now.
#
# So, when flashing, please flash
# build-singleimage/zephyr/zephyr_kohaku.bin instead until Zmake
# grows a configuration option to handle ecst.
