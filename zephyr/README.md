# Zephyr EC

[TOC]

## Introduction

Zephyr EC is an effort to create an industry-standard Embedded Controller
implementation for use primarily on laptops. It is born out of the Chromium OS
EC.

## Gitlab integration

As an experiment we have a basic gitlab integration. So far it just builds and
fails.

See the piplines [here](https://gitlab.com/zephyr-ec/ec/-/pipelines).
