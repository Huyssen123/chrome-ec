    description: LED Color nodes to describe the policy combination a node
                 depends on, and the color to set to for that combination.
                 e.g. If Blue color needs to be set for charge state discharge
                 in S0, a node looks like
                 power-state-discharge-s0 {
                    charge-state = "PWR_STATE_DISCHARGE";
                    chipset-state = "POWER_S0";
                    color-0 {
                      led-color = "LED_BLUE";

                         property is used to describe it.

            description: If the LED color depends on current battery level, this property
                         is used to describe the batt_lvl range using closed interval [x,y].
                         Use the macros defined in dt-bindings/battery.h.
                         e.g. <BATTERY_LEVEL_EMPTY BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW> describes battery level
                         range of BATTERY_LEVEL_EMPTY to BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW inclusive.
            type: array
