description: PWM LED pins parent node

compatible: "cros-ec,pwm-led-pins"

properties:
  pwm-frequency:

    description: Each child node describes all the PWM pins that need to be
                 altered to set a specific color. Eg. For blue and amber PWM
                 channels, in order to set color amber, a node looks like
                 this where 100 is PWM duty cycle in percentage
