description: GPIO LED configuration

compatible: "cros-ec,gpio-leds"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      List of the GPIOs controlling the LEDs. GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW
      can be used for low-side control of the signal.

      For example
        led1 {
                compatible = "cros-ec,gpio-leds";

                pwms = <&gpioc 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,
                       <&gpioc 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
        };

  color-list:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Maps the requested colors from the EC host command
      to the appropriate GPIO channel. So,

          color-list = <BLUE YELLOW>;

      Would return the EC brightness array

          [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
