      List of USB-C muxes and retimers for the USB-C port. The USB-C subsystem
      traverses this list in the order specified. The phandles are references to
      cros-ec,usbc-mux nodes.


# Example:
#	usbc {
#		#address-cells = <1>;
#		#size-cells = <0>;
#
#		/* Reg property is used to assign a port number */
#		port0@0 {
#			compatible = "named-usbc-port";
#			reg = <0>;
#			bc12 {
#				compatible = "pericom,pi3usb9201";
#				port = <&i2c_ec_i2c_usb_c0>;
#			};
#		};
#		port1@1 {
#			compatible = "named-usbc-port";
#			reg = <1>;
#			bc12 {
#				compatible = "pericom,pi3usb9201";
#				port = <&i2c_ec_i2c_sub_usb_c1>;
