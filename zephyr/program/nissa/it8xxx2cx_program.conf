# IT8xxx2 CX targets rv32imafc whereas BX needs to target rv32iafc due to a CPU
# bug. The toolchain provides library support for these targets:
#
#  * rv32iac/ilp32
#  * rv32iafc/ilp32 (alias to iac/ilp32)
#  * rv32imafc/ilp32f
#
# ..so when targeting -imafc for the CX chip, we need to use the hard-float ABI
# to prevent ABI mismatches against libgcc whereas BX must use soft-float for
# the same reason.
CONFIG_FLOAT_HARD=y
