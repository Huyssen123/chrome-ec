menuconfig AP_PWRSEQ
	bool "AP Power sequencing support"
	select HAS_TASK_POWERBTN
	help
	  Enables AP power sequencing support with
	  embedded controller. This includes normal shutdown, critical
	  shutdown and reset handling.
	  Enabling this automatically enables HAS_TASK_POWERBTN since this task
	  is required to handle power button pressed/released by user.

config AP_PWRSEQ_AUTOSTART
	bool "Start the power sequence thread automatically"
	default n
	help
	  This option starts the AP power sequence task
	  at initialisation. If not set, ap_pwrseq_thread_start()
	  needs to be called to start the task.

	  Disable this option if there is other board or module
	  initialization that must occur before the AP power sequence
	  thread is started.

	int "AP pwrseq stack size (in bytes)"
	default 800
	help
	  This option specifies the size of the stack used by the
	  AP power sequencing state machine thread handler.

config X86_NON_DSX_PWRSEQ
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option enables Non Deep Sleep Well power sequencing for
	  Intel x86 chips.

	  This enables AP power sequecing support for Intel Alderlake
	  family of chipset.
